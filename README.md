# Cleaning Spending Patterns Dataset

## Description
This project focuses on cleaning and preprocessing a dataset containing information on spending patterns. The goal is to prepare the data for further analysis by removing unnecessary columns and addressing data quality issues.

## Features
- Loading the dataset from a CSV file.
- Exploring the dataset's structure and contents.
- Cleaning steps including the removal of irrelevant columns.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Programming language used for data manipulation.
- **Pandas**: Library for data analysis and manipulation.
- **NumPy**: Library for numerical computations.

## Dataset
The dataset is stored in a CSV file named `uncleaned_spending_patterns.csv`. It contains information such as:
- Transaction details
- Customer demographics
- External factors like mood, weather, and location

## Usage
The uncleaned data in `uncleaned_spending_patterns.csv` was cleaned and preprocessed using the Jupyter Notebook `Cleaning_data.ipynb`. To replicate this:
1. Place the dataset file (`uncleaned_spending_patterns.csv`) in the same directory as the Jupyter Notebook.
2. Open the notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Cleaning_data.ipynb
   ```
3. Run the cells in the notebook to clean and preprocess the data.
